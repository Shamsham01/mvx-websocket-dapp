## ⚡ Real-Time Data: MultiversX WebSocket Subscriptions
**Don't poll the blockchain. Let the blockchain notify you.**

MakeX now supports **Custom Filtered Transactions** via WebSocket. This allows you to feed live, real-time on-chain data directly into Make.com or third-party applications.

### Step 1: Create Your Webhook
To start receiving data, you must first have a destination.
1.  Go to **Make.com** and create a "Custom Webhook" trigger.
2.  Copy the generated Webhook URL.
3.  Use this URL when configuring your MakeX Subscription.

### Step 2: Configure `subscribeCustomTransfers`
We support the `subscribeCustomTransfers` event, which tracks the **complete stream of actions**—including standard transactions, Smart Contract Results (SCRs), and Rewards.

**Available Filters (Payload DTO):**
You can configure your subscription to filter noise and only trigger your scenario for specific events.

| Filter Field | Description | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **address** | **Universal Filter.** Matches if the address is the Sender OR Receiver OR Relayer. | The preferred mode for tracking the full real-time activity of a specific user or wallet. |
| **token** | Filter by Token Identifier (e.g., `USDC-c76f1f` or `EGLD`). | Perfect for tracking volume or trades of a specific project token. |
| **function** | Filter by smart contract function name (e.g., `stake`, `claimRewards`). | Trigger automations only when a user interacts with a specific contract method. |
| **sender** | Filter by sender address (bech32). | Monitor specific wallets for outgoing payments. |
| **receiver** | Filter by receiver address (bech32). | Monitor a deposit address or treasury for incoming funds. |

## 🧠 Build No-Code AI Agents
**The era of "DeFAI" (Decentralized Finance AI) is here.**

By combining the new **Make AI Agents** with **MakeX**, you can build autonomous, wallet-equipped assistants that think, decide, and act on-chain—no coding required.

*   **Manage Portfolios:** Build agents that monitor market sentiment and asset prices in real-time to execute token swaps and treasury moves, optimizing your holdings 24/7 without human intervention.
*   **Balance Treasuries:** Create a "Treasury Manager" agent instructed to "maintain 50% in stablecoins and stake the rest." The agent will autonomously calculate ratios and execute the necessary rebalancing transactions.
*   **Manage Communities:** Deploy "Swarm Agents" that analyze Discord engagement or X (Twitter) sentiment, automatically identifying key contributors and rewarding them with NFT airdrops or token tips.
*   **Perform On-Chain Tasks:** From sweeping NFT floors based on trait rarity to executing complex smart contract "Warps," your agents can handle sophisticated blockchain operations using natural language logic.
